## A Tea Loverâ€™s Way to Enjoy Tea Mindfully (Without the Guilt!)

Who doesnâ€™t love hot tea?

The rich aroma, the warmth, and the comforting feeling in every sipâ€”it's pure heaven.

But still, we canâ€™t drink it as often as weâ€™d like, especially when weâ€™re on a weight-loss journey. Tea can cause issues when consumed the wrong way.

As a hardcore tea lover, I honestly canâ€™t consider green tea or any other tea as _real_ tea.

That said, Iâ€™ve learned a few ways to enjoy tea while keeping it less harmful to the bodyâ€”and still make the most of the experience. Sharing a few of my go-to hacks:

---

### âœ… 1. Avoid drinking tea on an empty stomach.

It can lead to sugar spikes and bloating, especially during your productive morning hours.

I usually prefer to have tea after brunchâ€”it gives that extra satisfaction after a good meal.

---

### âœ… 2. Reduce the quantity, not the joy.

I bought a small silver tumbler to drink my tea.

Now, I enjoy **two small cups a day** instead of one big one. Same calories. More satisfaction.

---

### âœ… 3. Cut down sugar, slowly.

True tea lovers know: the real taste comes from the tea leaves, not the sugar.

But sugar helps cut the bitterness, so I get it! Try adding **a little less each day**â€”even just a grain or two less.

(I havenâ€™t reached the sugar-free stage yet, but Iâ€™m working on it! ðŸ˜„)

---

### âœ… 4. Adjust milk-to-water ratio.

My tea is **1/5 milk, 4/5 water**. I donâ€™t like dense teaâ€”watery consistency works best for me.

Find the ratio that makes you feel good!

---

### âœ… 5. Be present during tea time.

Avoid distractions like TV, mobile scrollingâ€”even books.

This is sacred time between **you and your tea**. When youâ€™re fully present, even a small cup feels luxurious and satisfying.

---

### âœ… 6. Donâ€™t pair tea with snacks.

No vada, no biscuitsâ€”especially on a weight-loss journey.

Weâ€™re already compromising and drinking tea, so letâ€™s not turn it into a calorie party. Keep the ritual simple and mindful.

---

### âœ… 7. Avoid tea from outside shops.

You canâ€™t always explain to the "tea anna" all your preferences.

Sometimes itâ€™s too strong, too sweet, or just off. I prefer to make my own tea at homeâ€”controlled, consistent, and satisfying.

**If you have your own tea hacks**

, please share them with me.

Iâ€™d love to try new ways to enjoy my favorite ritual. ðŸ’›
