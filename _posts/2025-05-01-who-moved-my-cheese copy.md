A long time ago, in a maze, there lived four little characters named Hem, Haw, Sniff, and Scurry. Hem and Haw were two little people who had emotions and thinking similar to human beings. Sniff and Scurry were two little mice with simple brains, and they didn’t complicate things.

These four characters set out on a mission to find cheese in the maze. Sniff and Scurry used the trial-and-error method and, after a long search, found cheese at Cheese Station C. The cheese was delicious, and the two little mice started enjoying it.

Hem and Haw used their complex brains and eventually also found the cheese at Cheese Station C. They were overjoyed upon seeing the cheese. They celebrated their discovery with their friends. As days went by, Sniff and Scurry developed a routine: they woke up early, went to Cheese Station C, tied their shoes around their necks, and started nibbling on the cheese.

But the two little people, Hem and Haw, although initially enthusiastic and careful, gradually began to take things for granted. They stopped waking up early and didn’t even know where their shoes were.

They became overconfident and focused only on enjoying the cheese.

As usual, one day, Sniff and Scurry visited the cheese station—but this time, there was no cheese.

They quickly assessed the situation. Since they had anticipated this could happen, they simply began searching for new cheese in the maze again.

When Hem and Haw arrived at the station, they were shocked to find the cheese gone. They couldn't handle the situation.

They started crying and yelling at each other.

Their complex brains didn’t allow them to think clearly.

They stayed there, hoping that someone would put the cheese back.

As days passed, their hunger and stress increased due to the lack of food.

They even dug into the walls of the cheese station but found nothing.

Out of stress, Haw started laughing—at his own mistakes.

He realised the current situation was becoming more painful, and he decided to do what he would do if he were not afraid.

He asked his friend Hem to join him in searching for cheese again in the maze.

But Hem refused to leave. He said, “The cheese will soon appear here. I can’t leave this place.”

Haw couldn’t convince his friend, so he restarted his journey alone into the maze.

Since he hadn’t run in a long time, he didn’t have the energy to go far. But he gathered his courage and started running again through the [maze](http://maze.here/).

Still, the journey was very difficult.

He thought of going back to Hem, but then he realised that staying there meant living without food.

So he created a mental picture of himself enjoying new cheese,it gives him some courage to continue the journey and kept running.

This mental image gave him more strength to move forward.

Here and there, he found small bits of cheese. Though it wasn’t enough, he appreciated even the little that he had and kept going.

After many days of running, Haw finally found Cheese Station N.

Sniff and Scurry were already there, happily enjoying their cheese. They welcomed Haw with a warm smile.

He believed , if he had left from the Cheese station C , he would have found the cheese Sooner.

Haw felt worried for his friend Hem, who never left Cheese Station C to look for new cheese.
